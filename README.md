Does what it says on the tin.

Enter a (valid) Spotify album URL, receive a poster!

### Issues/Limitations (to be fixed maybe):
- [ ] Special characters not supported
- [ ] No scaling for too many characters
- [ ] Better font
- [X] No checking for validity of URL
- [ ] Choose poster size

You'll need a .env file with the following values:
- SPOTIFY_SECRET = `your spotify secret code`
- SPOTIFY_ID = `your spotify client id`
- FLASK_SECRET = `your flask secret code`

The website probably wont be up all the time, just email me if you need one.
